Smart Title Analysis Features
Duplicate Title Detection:

Use the original_title_id and segments_count data you're already parsing to identify duplicate playlists
Add a "Smart Selection" mode that auto-selects the best version when duplicates are found
Show warnings like "Title #3 appears to be duplicate of #1 (same duration, different playlist)"

Main Feature Detection:

Implement heuristics based on duration patterns - main features are typically much longer than extras
Use chapter count as an indicator (main features usually have 8-20+ chapters)
Add a preference for "Main Feature Only" mode for movies

User Experience Improvements
Batch Operations:

Multi-select in the queue tree to apply settings to multiple discs at once
"Select All Main Features" button that uses smart detection
Bulk output folder assignment

Better Progress Information:

Show estimated time remaining for entire queue (not just current job)
Display ripping speed (MB/s) in status
Add estimated completion time for queue

Enhanced Logging:

Option to save a summary report after queue completion
Track which titles were actually ripped vs skipped
Show space saved by skipping duplicates/unwanted titles

Advanced MakeMKV Integration
Profile Management:

Built-in profile editor for common use cases (different quality settings)
Quick profile switching per job or title
Preset profiles for "Archival Quality", "Streaming Optimized", etc.

Error Recovery:

Retry failed jobs with different settings automatically
Skip bad sectors option with user confirmation
Resume interrupted rips if MakeMKV supports it

Metadata Enhancements
Title Intelligence:

Parse more stream flags from the apdefs.h definitions you have
Better detection of commentary tracks, alternate angles, forced subtitles
Show which audio tracks are lossless vs lossy

Disc Information:

Parse and display disc protection info (AACS, BD+, etc.)
Show disc region information if available
Display total disc capacity and free space calculations

Most Practical Next Steps
If I had to prioritize, I'd suggest:

Duplicate title detection - This solves a real problem with many commercial discs
Smart main feature selection - Saves time for movie collections
Better queue progress estimates - Makes long operations more user-friendly
Batch selection operations - Improves workflow for large collections

The duplicate detection would be particularly valuable since many Blu-rays have 3-4 copies of the main feature in different playlists, and your parser already extracts the data needed to identify them.
Which of these areas interests you most, or do you have a specific workflow pain point you'd like to address?
